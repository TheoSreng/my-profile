            <h2>I little chronology</h2>
            <p>I started playing video games with my mother and my brother on the playstation 2 and the Nintendo wii when i was arround 5 or 6 years old. We played booling, tennis, gold and a lot more on Wii sport and a lot of minigames on Wii play; on the playstation 2, it was more PES 2004 or 2005. I bit latter when I was arround 8, my grandfather gave me his old laptop, that is the moment I really started playing video games. The computer was really slow and was struggling to run games like Minecraft, one of the first game I played. Later on, I started playing Counter Strike: Global Offensive with one of my friend. it was the first FPS game I ever played but it was at that time that I fell in love with FPS. </p>

            <p>
                Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) is a 2012 multiplayer tactical first-person shooter developped by Valve and Hidden Path Entertainment. The game pits two teams, Terrorists and Counter-Terrorists, against each other in different objective-based game modes. The most common game modes involve the Terrorists planting a bomb while Counter-Terrorists attempt to stop them, or Counter-Terrorists attempting to rescue hostages that the Terrorists have captured. There are nine official game modes, all of which have distinct characteristics specific to that mode.
                This game was the first FPS I played and I never stopped playing it. I have so many memories with my friends trying our best to get to the gigher rank possible.

            <h3>Valorant</h3>
            <img src="image folder/valorant.jpg" id="valorant" alt="Valorant" />
            <p>Valorant is a free-to-play first-person tactical shooter developed and published by Riot Games. Valorant takes inspiration from the Counter-Strike series of tactical shooters, borrowing mechanics such as the buy menu, spray patterns and inaccuracy while moving.Players play as one of a set of Agents, characters based on several countries and cultures around the world. In the main game mode, players are assigned to either the attacking or defending team with each team having five players on it. Agents have unique abilities, each requiring charges, as well as a unique ultimate ability that requires charging through kills, deaths, orbs, or objectives. The standard game mode is a match played as best of 25, the first team to win 13 rounds wins the match. The attacking team has a bomb-type device called the Spike. They must deliver and activate the Spike on one of the multiple specified locations (bomb sites). If the attacking team successfully protects the activated Spike for 45 seconds it detonates, destroying everything in a specific area, and they receive a point. If the defending team can deactivate the spike, or the 100-second round timer expires without the attacking team activating the spike, the defending team receives a point. If all the members of a team are eliminated before the spike is activated, or if all members of the defending team are eliminated after the spike is activated, the opposing team earns a point. As this game is a CSGO like game, the transition to this game is quite easy for a CSGO player. Now I can switch from CSGO to Valorant and reverse wise depending on my mood.</p>
