            <h2>How it all started</h2>
            <p>I started playing volleyball after watching Haikyuu!! a Japanese TV show. I went to a club in 2019 and from this point I've never stopped playing and practicing. It was the first sport I really was hooked on. Even during the pandemic crisis of the corona virus, I practiced at home working on my vertical jump. This activity really had a great impact on me: I developped a great team spirit and it helpped me lose a lot of weight. </p>
