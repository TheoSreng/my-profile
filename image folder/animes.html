            <H1>Animes</H1>
            <p>Outside of Japan, anime is a term used for animation produced in Japan. However, in Japan, anime describes all animated works, regardless of style or origin. Animation produced outside of Japan with similar style to Japanese animation is commonly reffered to as anime-influenced animation.The anime industry consists of over 430 production companies, including major studios such as Studio Ghibli, Kyoto Animation, Sunrise, Bones, Ufotable, MAPPA, Wit Studio, CoMix Wave Films, Production I.G and Toei Animation. Since the 1980s, the medium has also seen widespread international success with the rise of foreign dubbed, subtitled programming, and since the 2010s its increasing distribution through streaming services and a widening demographic embrace of anime culture, both within Japan and worldwide. As of 2016, Japanese animation accounted for 60% of the world's animated television shows. </p>

            <h2>Anime and I</h2>
            <p>I started watching anime since i was little. People arround me grew up watching cartoons, I did not. I watched few french and American cartoons but I mainly watched japanese anime. My uncle is a fan of japanese animation so when he went abroad to live in Singapor, he left all his DVDs in France. That's how I started watching Dragon Ball and then Dragon Ball Z. My childhood is full of memories filled with anime such as Captain tsubasa, Saint seiya: knights of the zodiac, Samourai Pizza Cats and a lot more...</p>

            <p>Animes are also for me a way to escape reality. I have always struggled making friends as an introvert, and I wasn't comfortable going out because I was complexed about my weight. In those times when I felt lonely in my bedroom, Animes were for me a way to escape. The way the autors develop their characters make them relatable depending on the anime you watch. I watch a lot of School life, slice of life type so in these types, the characters and their behaviors can be quite similar to those of real person. Watching these characters growing and working on themselves really pushed me to try it myself. </p>

            <h2>Wouah</h2>
            <p>Nowadays, the studios can really drop some animations which are visually increadible. I think images are way batter than word to illustrate it, so I invite you to look at those few exemples.</p>
